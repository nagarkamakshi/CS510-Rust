# Shortest-Path

The c++ code for comparing Shortest-Path Algorithms such as
Dijsktra's Algorithm for Single source
Bellman ford for single source

Floyd Warshall for all pair Shortest Path
Dijsktra for all pair shortest path

# Build and run

It requires C++ compiler to build the program Shortest-Path.cpp
compiler will create a binary
the run times for algorithms will be in output.csv file in your directory.
